# Codext (SaaS) Website Landing Page

**Hi everyone, I am Raushan.**

> This webpage is a landing page of a SaaS website called Codext built purely in HTML and CSS😎.

This project was fairly a revision kind one to go through all the concepts learnt in CSS and reapply them. It was fairly an easier project than one I was doing last time. Basic concepts of CSS did the job pretty well😃.

>This project took 2.5 hours to complete it.

Below is the view and link of the project👇👇👇
